<h2>Design Process<h2>

<br>
<p> - As a card game lover, I would love to be able to find the games produced by a company easily as well as be able to purchase them online.</p>
<br>
<p> - As a tech user, I would like to be able to read all about a game and how it is played online rather then read a physical rulebook.</p>

<p> - As an indecisive user, I would like you be able to read about a game before making the decision of buying it.</p>
